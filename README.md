# CAR PRICE PREDICTION REGRESSION ANALYSIS

## Introduction
The objective of this project is to predict car prices using linear regression and hypothesis testing. By analyzing the factors that influence car prices, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate the price of a car based on its features and specifications.

## Business Understanding
The car business in Kenya is situated at the confluence of urbanisation, economic expansion, and changing customer tastes. With more people living in cities and more people needing cars, the local automaker wants to use data to identify opportunities in the market and solve problems. In partnership with a car advisory service, the business looks for in-depth understanding of the various aspects that affect car costs.

## Problem Statetment
The local company must optimise its price based on multiple independent variables due to the intricate dynamics of the Kenyan vehicle market. The principal aim is to create a prediction model that can precisely approximate automobile prices by comprehending the correlation between car characteristics and pricing, so giving the enterprise a tactical edge in a cutthroat industry.
